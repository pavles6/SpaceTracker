#### SpaceX launch tracker ðŸš€

## Description
 SpaceXplorer is my personal project made with [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) and [TailwindCSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss). You can search and explore the details of every single rocket launch SpaceX has ever done. 

## Highlights
- It renders data from [r-SpaceX API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API) 
- Launch pages are pre-rendered at the build-time which makes fluid app usage experience.
- Search results are paginated, which eliminates the unneccessary traffic
- Fully responsive pages
- Dark theme
- [MIT License](https://github.com/pavles6/SpaceXplorer/blob/master/LICENSE.md)

## Future
- There is still room for the application to become more data richer, depending on my motivation I might update some stuff. Early plans and ideas are in to-do list
- Current state of the app is just 1.0 version as I planned it throughout the development.
- ### To-do List
  - [ ] More search filters - Upcoming launches, date picker to choose a date range
  - [ ] More details on launch pages: launchpad and landpad data, info about specific cores used in a launch
  - [ ] Pages about rockets
  - [ ] Statistics page: graphs and analaytics about the company


#### [App is currently hosted](https://space-xplorer.vercel.app) on vercel for showcasing purposes.
