#### The collection of every SpaceX rocket launch ðŸš€

## Motivation
Looking around existing adaptations of [r-SpaceX API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API) I haven't seen any app or a website that manages to display neccessary data around the topic of launches and their details on clean, modern and good-looking UI while it also being simple to use. That gave me a motivation to make the SpaceXplorer: my personal project in a form of a web application where you can search and explore the details about every single rocket launch SpaceX has ever done. 

## Highlights
- Uses [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js), a unbelievably fast React.js Framework for SSR and static site generation.
- It renders data from [r-SpaceX API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API).
- Launch pages are pre-rendered at build time.
- Search results are paginated, which eliminates the unneccessary traffic between the client and the server.
- Fully device responsive app.
- Light and dark UI themes.

## Future
- There is still room for the application to become more data richer, depending on my motivation I might update some stuff. Early plans and ideas are in to-do list
- Current state of the app is just 1.0 version as I planned it throughout the development.
- ### To-do List
  - [ ] More search filters - Upcoming launches, date picker to choose a date range
  - [ ] More details on launch pages: launchpad and landpad data, info about specific cores used in a launch
  - [ ] Pages about rockets
  - [ ] Statistics page: graphs and analaytics about the company


#### [App is currently hosted](https://space-xplorer.vercel.app) on vercel for showcasing purposes.
