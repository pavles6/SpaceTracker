## Collection of every SpaceX rocket launch ðŸš€

- Made with [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js), a React.js Framework.
- Uses data from [r-SpaceX API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API).
- Fully responsive user interface.
- Light and dark UI themes.

## Future

- There is still room for the application to become more data richer, depending on my motivation I might update some stuff. Early plans and ideas are in to-do list
- ### To-do List
  - [ ] More search filters - Upcoming launches, date picker to choose a date range
  - [ ] More details on launch pages: launchpad and landpad data, info about specific cores used in a launch
  - [ ] Pages about rockets
  - [ ] Statistics page: graphs and analaytics about the company

#### [App is currently hosted](https://space-xplorer.vercel.app) on vercel for showcasing purposes.
